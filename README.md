# AWS-Infra-Terraform

This respository consists of Terraform files for deploying infrastructure in AWS using Terraform.

Once the terraform code is commited in IDE, a pull request will be created using GitHub Actions and upon approval "terraform plan" will be executed and resources will be deployed.

This will create a two-tier architecture in AWS.
